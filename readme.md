## Getting started

In order to use the theme, you'll need to setup a [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com) account and site. 

After you’ve downloaded the theme, upload the zip folder through the Siteleaf “Themes” page. After the theme has been uploaded, you should be able to preview your site and see the theme in action (assuming you have content in place).

## Adding content

There are two content types in Siteleaf — Pages and Posts. In Shaken Grid, a gallery is a Page and the grid items displayed are Posts. To start, create a page and call it "Gallery". After you save the page, you can begin adding posts to it.

## Gallery items

As mentioned above, gallery items are Siteleaf Posts. When displaying posts, the theme will grab the first asset of each post and display it as the featured image above the title and body/excerpt. If you upload multiple assets, you can reorder them to select the image you want to display at the top.

## Custom post excerpts

When posts are displayed in a group, the theme will truncate the post body to 200 characters. If you want to write a custom excerpt, create a meta field on your post with a key of `excerpt` and write your custom excerpt as the meta field `value`.

## Custom CSS and Analytics

If you need to add code to your theme, but don't feel like customizing the theme, you can utilize Siteleaf's site meta fields. There are three built-in site meta fields: `head`, `body_top` and `body_bottom`. You can create a site meta field at the bottom of your site's settings page in the Siteleaf dashboard.
